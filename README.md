This is a project I'm doing to learn how to use CSS, HTML and JS together. I'm following a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev). I recommend the course for anyone who wants to learn how to use CSS, HTML and JS together.
